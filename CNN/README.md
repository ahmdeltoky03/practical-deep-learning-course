## CNN Image Classification Notebook (Educational Example)

This notebook demonstrates a basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for binary image classification using synthetic or educational image data.

### Overview

- **Data Input**: Images loaded from a local directory using OpenCV.
- **Preprocessing**: Resizing and normalization for model readiness.
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, OpenCV, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow/Keras.
- **Model**: Simple CNN built with Keras for binary classification.
- **Use Case**: Educational demonstration of an end-to-end CNN pipeline.
