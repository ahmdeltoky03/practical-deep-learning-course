Added a Jupyter Notebook (`intel-image-classification.ipynb`) that performs image classification using the Intel Image Classification dataset.

The notebook includes:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model definition
- Model training and validation
- Evaluation metrics and visualizations (e.g., accuracy, loss plots)
- Comments and structure for reproducibility

This serves as a foundational pipeline for image classification tasks and can be extended for experimentation or deployment.
